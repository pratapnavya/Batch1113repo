Hi Koshal,

I'm practicing Git for the day and will complete all the 8 videos by this week end. I applied a leave tomorrow and will complete this all these videos with notes by this saturday and wil start linux commands practice as well.

Also I informed Tejaswani to give me some time to update my linked in profikle.

Will complete that also as early as possible and keep upto date.
